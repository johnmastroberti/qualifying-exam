\section*{Notes}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Qual is 16 problems, given over two days with 5 hours per day
\begin{itemize}
\item
This is 37.5 minutes per problem

\end{itemize}

\item
We have 8 past qualifying exams, with roughly equal numbers of problems drawn from
\begin{itemize}
\item
Classical Mechanics (basically all on first day)

\item
Quantum Mechanics (all on second day)

\item
Electromagnetism (split equally between days)

\item
Statistical Physics (more on first day)

\end{itemize}

\item
With 2 exams reserved for practice exams, we have 6 left to draw problems from
\begin{itemize}
\item
6 exams $\times$ 4 problems per subject per exam $=$ 24 problems per subject

\item
Distributed evenly among the 8 main review weeks, this is 12 problems per week, $\approx 7.5$ hours given an average of $37.5$ minutes per problem

\end{itemize}

\item
If possible, I think we should try to have the professors present during the July review days for their respective subject

\end{itemize}
