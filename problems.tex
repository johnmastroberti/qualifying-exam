\section*{Schedule}

Starting in June, we will meet each week on Friday evening to discuss the problems for that week.
Everyone should solve as many of that week's problems as possible before the meeting.
For example, when we meet on Friday, June 4th, everyone should have attempted
problems 1 and 3 from 2018, 2016, and 2014, and problems 2 and 15 from 2017, 2015, and 2013.
These are all mechanics problems, except for problems numbered 15 which deal with relativity.
